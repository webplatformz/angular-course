                <h2>Types of Components</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>The larger a project, the more components we build. Taking it component-by-component turns the application into a
                    <u>unmanageable sea of components</u>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Why is it a problem, if all components «look the same»?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>mental model is overwhelming: keeping track of data flow and dependencies gets increasingly more difficult, more effort to onboard new team members, new features take longer, changes are riskier</li>
                    <li>debugging is harder: more places where responsible code could be</li>
                    <li>testing is more complex</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Structure your components</h2>
                <p>Delegate different jobs to different components. There are multiple ways to differentiate components, the easiest one is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>smart components: contain (business) logic, handle user events, interactive</li>
                    <li>dumb components: also called container components, they only bootstrap other components and build the connection between them, layouting</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Atomic Design</h2>
                <p>The principle of atomic design takes this principle to another level:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Atoms:</li>
                    <li>Molecules:</li>
                    <li>Organisms:</li>
                </ul>
